# 📍 The Process
This project is my first front-end development project and was created to test and apply what I learned while studying core 
front-end languages. I was inspired by online videos showcasing similar “ask your crush out” websites; however, many of them 
felt visually dull and overly basic. I wanted to challenge myself by improving the design and user experience while keeping 
the concept simple and playful. Through this project, I experimented with layout, styling, and interactive behavior to 
better understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together in a complete front-end application.
